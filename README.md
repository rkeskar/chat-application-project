# chat-application-project

This is a basic whatsapp type group chat application for Drexel Alumni.

In this application, the user has to sign up first and then then he/she can log in.

Once the user logs in, he enters into the chat room. The user can see the entire chats which happened in his/her absence. So, therefore, it acts like a Whatsapp group. In addition, the time is also displayed along with the chats.

The steps to be followed are :-

1. Install any local web server like LAMP, XAMPP etc., I used XAMPP for this project

2. Import the mydatabase.sql in your server. It is basically a database. It consists of two tables, one signup and the other posts.

3. Once, you are done importing that, install all the files at a location. All files should be in same folder.

4. After downloading the files, you run index.php file. This will start the application.

5. Any number of users can login the chat room and chat. Make sure that you use different web browser for each login.

6. For viewing the current chat you will have to refresh the page.

7. Once you logout, and then login again after sometime, you can see the chats at those time as well.
