# chat-application-project

This is a basic whatsapp type group chat application for Drexel Alumni.

In this application, the user has to sign up first and then then he/she can log in.

Once the user logs in, he enters into the chat room. The user can see the entire chats which happened in his/her absence. So, therefore, it acts like a Whatsapp group. In addition, the time is also displayed along with the chats.

The steps to be followed are :-

1. Install any local web server like LAMP, XAMPP etc., I used XAMPP for this project

2. Import the mydatabase.sql in your server. It is basically a database. It consists of two tables, one signup and the other posts.

3. Once, you are done importing that, install all the files at a location. All files should be in same folder.

4. After downloading the files, you run index.php file. This will start the application.


This project is build on Model View Controller architecture.
